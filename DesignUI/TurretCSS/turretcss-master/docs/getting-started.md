## Introduction

turretcss makes creating responsive, accessible, mobile-first web interfaces simple. turretcss provides a robust CSS foundation of HTML typography, forms, and elements that are easy to customise and style.

## Contents

* Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding the "Contents" header
{:toc}

## Quick start

### CDN

Include the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.cdn }}" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### Template

turretcss makes use of HTML5 elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    
    <!-- Page Title -->
    <title>turretcss</title>
    
    <!-- turretcss CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ site.cdn }}" crossorigin="anonymous">
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

### Boilerplate

The turretcss-boilerplate is a basic boilerplate using [turretcss][turretcss], [PostCSS][PostCSS], [PostCSS CLI][PostCSS CLI], [cssnext][cssnext], and [CSSNano][CSSNano].

## Download

### Download

Download the turretcss repo to include ready-to-use CSS code to easily drop into your project. Includes compiled and minified versions of the turretcss CSS.

<p>
  <a class="button button-primary" href="https://github.com/turretcss/turretcss/archive/master.zip">Download from GitHub</a>
</p>

### GitHub

Clone the repo from GitHub download the source CSS, and documentation files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turretcss/turretcss.git
```

### npm

Install turretcss for your Node powered apps with the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turretcss):

```bash
npm install turretcss
```

### yarn

Install turretcss with [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```bash
yarn add turretcss
```

## Usage

### Selectors

Where styles are applied on HTML elements with classes, the structuring of classes is element, modifier, style.

```html
<element class="[element] [element-modifier] [element-style]">...</element>
```

 For example the .button class can extended to button button-block button-primary

```html
<button class="button button-border button-primary">...</button>
```

### Normalize

For improved cross-browser rendering, turretcss includes [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), a project by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal.

### Sizes

turretcss uses a generic language for size scale. The scale ranges from xs to xl (xs, s, m, l, xl) and is applicable for both responsive breakpoints, and the HTML elements themselves.

#### Device Sizes

Responsive breakpoints are configurable via setting [@custom-media queries](/docs/base/#media-queries), by default these are configured to the following pixel sizes:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="25%">Breakpoint</th>
        <th width="25%">Device</th>
        <th width="25%">Min Width</th>
        <th width="25%">Max Width</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>xs</td>
        <td>Phone</td>
        <td class="color-grey background-light-100">None</td>
        <td>767px</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>s</td>
        <td>Tablet</td>
        <td>768px</td>
        <td>1023px</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>m</td>
        <td>Laptop</td>
        <td>1024px</td>
        <td>1279px</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>l</td>
        <td>Desktop</td>
        <td>1280px</td>
        <td>1679px</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>xl</td>
        <td>Large Screen</td>
        <td>1680px</td>
        <td class="color-grey background-light-100">None</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### Element Sizes

Each interactive element - such as `<input>`, `<select>`, `<button>`, etc. - have sizes that can be applied with optional classes, for example `.button-s`.

The height of these elements is set by [global height variables](/docs/globals/#height).

Element sizes examples:

* [Input Sizes](/docs/form/#input-sizes)
* [Input Group Sizes](/docs/form/#input-group-sizes)
* [Control Sizes](/docs/form/#control-sizes)
* [Select Sizes](/docs/form/#select-sizes)
* [Range Sizes](/docs/form/#range-sizes)
* [Progress Sizes](/docs/form/#progress-sizes)
* [Button Sizes](/docs/elements/#button-sizes)

### States

Any element that has states - hover, focus, active, selected etc. - has default options that can be set these include: `color`, `background`, `border-color`, and `shadow`. These states inherit  styles (`box-shadow`) that are configured [globally](/docs/globals/#box-shadow) as well as specific state styles that can be configures per element, and style.

### Indicators

Each interactive element - such as `<input>`, `<select>`, `<button>`, etc. - have indicator styles that are applied with global classes:

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.error`   | Applies [error color styles](/docs/globals/#error) to element |
| `.warning` | Applies [warning color styles](/docs/globals/#warning) to element  |
| `.success` | Applies [success color styles](/docs/globals/#success) to element  |
| `.info`    | Applies [info color styles](/docs/globals/#info) to element  |

Element indicators examples:

* [Input Indicators](/docs/form/#input-indicators)
* [Control Indicators](/docs/form/#control-indicators)
* [Select Indicators](/docs/form/#select-indicators)
* [Range Indicators](/docs/form/#range-indicators)
* [Progress Indicators](/docs/form/#progress-indicators)
* [Button Indicators](/docs/elements/#button-indicators)

### Structure

The turretcss source code download includes the precompiled CSS, along with source CSS, and documentation.

The source file structure is as follows:

```
turret/
  └ dist/
    └ turret.min.css
  └ docs/
  └ turret/
```

The `turret` directory contains the source code CSS. The `dist` directory includes precompiled CSS. The `docs` directory includes the source code for our documentation. Any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.

## Build Tools

### [PostCSS][PostCSS]

turretcss makes use of [PostCSS][PostCSS] and [cssnext][cssnext] to compile modern CSS into browser compatible CSS. Each element of turretcss is inlcuded in individual CSS files that include variables set at the root scope. To use turretcss with [PostCSS][PostCSS] in your project you will need to import `turretcss/turret/turret.css` to include styles for all elements.

### [cssnext][cssnext]

To use turretcss with [cssnext][cssnext] in your project you will need to import `turret.css` to include styles for all elements.

### [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer]

turretcss uses [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer] as part of [cssnext][cssnext] to automatically add vendor prefixes to some CSS properties at build time.

### Styling

To theme turretcss you can override default style variables either within your own project styles or included as `variables.css` to `@import` in your styles.

```css
@import 'turretcss/turret/turret.css';

/* Override Primary Color */
:root {
    --primary: red;
}
```

</div>

#### Android Default Browser

The Default Android Browser is not supported. Android 4.4+ does not ship with a default Browser. (note: Chrome on Android is fully supported)

#### IE Compatibility modes

turretcss is not supported in the old Internet Explorer compatibility modes. To be sure you're using the latest rendering mode for IE, consider including the appropriate `<meta>` tag in your pages:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```

The meta tag tells the IE rendering engine it should use the latest, or edge, version of the IE rendering environment

### CSS

Some CSS properties and HTML5 attributes and elements are not fully supported by Internet Explorer 8 and 9.

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Use the `screen-reader` class to display content only for screen readers, based from the A11y Project post: [How-to: Hide Content](http://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/)

```scss
<div class="screen-reader">...</div>
```

#### Screen Reader Focusable

In conjunction with the `screen-reader` class, the `screen-reader-focusable` class can be added to only display content when it's focused. Useful for "Skip to main content" links.

```scss
<div class="screen-reader screen-reader-focusable">...</div>
```
