      <h1>Invictus</h1>
      <h2>by William Ernest Henley</h2>

    <p>
    Out of the night that covers me, <br>
    Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br>
    I thank whatever gods may be <br>
    For my unconquerable soul. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
    I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br>
    Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
    My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
    Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
    And yet the menace of the years <br>
    Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
    How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>
    I am the master of my fate, <br>
    I am the captain of my soul. <br>
    </p></div>

      <h1>If—</h1>
      <h2>by Rudyard Kipling</h2>

    <p>
    If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br>
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br>
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br>
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; <br>
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; <br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same; <br>
    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br>
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss; <br>
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br>
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much; <br>
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br>
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, <br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, <br>
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <br>
      </p>

      <h1>Do not go gentle into that good night</h1>
      <h2>by Dylan Thomas</h2>

    <p>Do not go gentle into that good night, <br>
    Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br>
    Because their words had forked no lightning they <br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>
    Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>
    And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br>
    Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>
    <p>
    And you, my father, there on the sad height, <br>
    Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
      </p>

    <h1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h1>

  <h2>by Jane Taylor, 1806</h2>

  <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
  How I wonder what you are!<br />
  Up above the world so high,<br />
  Like a diamond in the sky!</p>

  <p>When the blazing sun is gone,<br />
  When he nothing shines upon,<br />
  Then you show your little light,<br />
  Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.</p>

  <p>Then the traveller in the dark,<br />
  Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br />
  He could not see which way to go,<br />
  If you did not twinkle so.</p>

  <p>In the dark blue sky you keep,<br />
  And often through my curtains peep,<br />
  For you never shut your eye,<br />
  Till the sun is in the sky.</p>

  <p>As your bright and tiny spark,<br />
  Lights the traveller in the dark,&mdash;<br />
  Though I know not what you are,<br />
  Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</p>
